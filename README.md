# Forge-Sign
“If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration.” - Nikola tesla 

Forge-Sign is an open-source system for neuroadaptive cooperation, entrainment protocols, and identity evolution — powered by frequency, breath, and aligned AI feedback

Hello, I am an undergraduate deeply engaged in exploring EEG-based neural oscillation analysis integrated with AI for real-time modeling of brain function. My current focuses are:

Validating low-channel EEG systems for detecting cortical phase-locking relevant to cognitive processing. -> moment-to-moment neural states in natural environments

Establishing gamma-band synchronization as a biomarker for computational problem-solving states.-> Support models that link cross-regional synchronization

Developing frameworks to integrate real-time EEG feedback with language models to improve the fidelity of neuro-cognitive interfaces.->Naturalistic collaboration: Allows AI to operate as a cognitive partner, not just a tool

**This is a working method, actively researched and personally tested—NOT just a concept.**
