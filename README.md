Hello, I am an undergraduate deeply engaged in exploring EEG-based neural oscillation analysis, and intigration with AI systems for real-time modeling of brain function. My current focuses are:

Validating low-channel EEG systems for detecting cortical phase-locking relevant to cognitive processing. -> moment-to-moment neural states in natural environments

Establishing gamma-band synchronization as a biomarker for computational problem-solving states.-> Support models that link cross-regional synchronization

**This is a working method, actively researched and personally tested. Not just a concept.**

Despite promising preliminary results, my progress is hindered by **limited access to high-density EEG equipment (256+ channels)** and the absence of rigorous clinical validation necessary to advance these methods toward recognized standards. I am seeking collaboration or facility access that could support these efforts. Even an opportunity to observe research would be an invaluable stepping point.

Our Goal: **Developing frameworks to integrate real-time EEG feedback with language models to improve the fidelity of neuro-cognitive interfaces.->Naturalistic collaboration: Allows AI to operate as a cognitive partner, not just a tool**
